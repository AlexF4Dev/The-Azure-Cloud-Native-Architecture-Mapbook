Chapter 3 -Infrastructure Design focuses on infrastructure architecture with Azure. We will review the different concerns every infrastructure engineer and architect has to deal with on a daily basis. More specifically, we will cover the following topics:

•	The Azure Infrastructure Architecture Map

•	Zooming in on networking

•	Zooming in on monitoring

•	Zooming in on high availability and disaster recovery

•	Zooming in on backup and restore

•	Zooming in on HPC

•	The AKS Architecture Map. We will walk through a microservices use case based on AKS.

We will have a 360 view of doing infrastructure with Azure, the most common practices and pitfalls. We will see how challenging it is to have a consistent and coherent disaster recovery approach, by walking you through a concrete real-world use case on a globally distributed API offering. Last but not least, we will dedicate a good part of this chapter to AKS, which has become a first-class citizen in many architectures.
